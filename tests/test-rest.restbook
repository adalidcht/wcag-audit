Use roles that accurately describe the purpose or function of the element to assist assistive technology users in understanding the content and functionality of the page.\n\nSpecifically, refer to WCAG 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value): This guideline stresses the importance of providing programmatically determined names, roles, and values to elements in order to ensure that their purpose is clear to all users, including those using assistive technologies. By selecting the correct ARIA roles that match the actual roles and functions of the elements, you can enhance the accessibility of your website for all users.","Elements must meet enhanced color contrast ratio thresholds":"Recommendation: To address the violation regarding elements not meeting the enhanced color contrast ratio thresholds, ensure that the foreground text color and the background color have a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text according to WCAG 2.0 guidelines (1.4.6). Adjust the colors to meet these requirements, making the text easily readable for all users, including those with visual impairments.","Document should have one main landmark":"recommendation: Add a main landmark role to clearly identify the main content of the document. Use the `<main>` element in HTML to define the main content section. This aligns with WCAG 2.4.1 (Bypass Blocks) which aims to make it easier for users to navigate through content. The main landmark helps assistive technologies and users understand the structure of the webpage, improving accessibility.","Page should contain a level-one heading":"Recommendation: Add a level-one heading (`<h1>`) to the page to provide a clear and meaningful structure. Level-one headings help both sighted users and screen readers understand the main topic or purpose of the page. This action aligns with WCAG 2.4.1 (Bypass Blocks) which improves keyboard navigation and screen reader usability by providing a major landmark at the beginning of the content.","All page content should be contained by landmarks":"recommendation: Use landmark elements such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <aside>, <footer>, and <section> to clearly define and encapsulate different sections of your web page content. This will provide a clear structure for assistive technologies and users to navigate through the content more easily. Ensure that each landmark is appropriately labeled using ARIA roles (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) to convey their purpose accurately to all users.
